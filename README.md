Hello, my name is Melissa Ruiz and I'm studying the Certificate of Higher Education of Multiplatform Application Development in IES Puerto de la Cruz located in Tenerife, Canary Islands.
- I'm learning Java, Git, and on my own I am practicing C# and .NET Framework.
- I have worked since 2018 in the tech sector, especially as a database administrator. Now I'm taking the leap to increase my knowledge to be a developer.
